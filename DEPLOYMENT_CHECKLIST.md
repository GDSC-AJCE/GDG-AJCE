## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment (Spring Boot to Render)

#### A. Build the Backend
```powershell
cd server
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

#### B. Verify Build Success
```powershell
# Should see: BUILD SUCCESS
# JAR file location: target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### C. Commit and Push
```powershell
git add server/
git commit -m "Enhanced backend: Full Google Sheet integration with points calculation and CORS fix"
git push origin main
```

#### D. Render Auto-Deploy
- Render detects the push
- Automatically rebuilds and deploys
- Monitor logs in Render dashboard
- Wait for "Deploy succeeded" message

#### E. Verify Deployment
```powershell
# Test the endpoint
curl https://gdg-ajce.onrender.com/api/leaderboard | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -First 1
```

Expected response should include:
- Name
- Profile URL
- Institution
- Enrolled
- Profile Completed
- Skill Badges Completed
- Arcade Games Completed
- Trivia Games Completed
- Total Completions
- Points
- Progress
- Verified

### 2. Frontend Deployment (Vite to Netlify)

#### A. Test Locally First
```powershell
cd D:\DEV\GDG\Webiste
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5174 and verify:
- [x] Names display correctly
- [x] Rankings are sequential
- [x] Points are calculated
- [x] Top 3 performers show
- [x] Stats are accurate
- [x] Search works smoothly
- [x] Profile icons are clickable
- [x] No console errors

#### B. Build for Production
```powershell
npm run build
```

#### C. Test Production Build Locally
```powershell
npm run preview
```

#### D. Commit and Push
```powershell
git add src/
git add docs/
git commit -m "Frontend enhancements: Fixed data mapping, improved logic, optimized search"
git push origin main
```

#### E. Netlify Auto-Deploy
- Netlify detects the push
- Automatically builds and deploys
- Monitor build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Wait for "Published" status

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### Backend Verification

#### 1. API Endpoint Health
```powershell
curl -I https://gdg-ajce.onrender.com/api/leaderboard
```
**Expected**: HTTP 200 OK with CORS headers

#### 2. CORS Headers Present
```powershell
curl -I https://gdg-ajce.onrender.com/api/leaderboard | Select-String "Access-Control"
```
**Expected**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

#### 3. Data Structure
```powershell
curl https://gdg-ajce.onrender.com/api/leaderboard | ConvertFrom-Json | Select-Object -First 1
```
**Expected**: All new fields present (Points, Total Completions, Verified, etc.)

### Frontend Verification

#### 1. Open Production Site
Visit your Netlify URL (e.g., `https://your-site.netlify.app`)

- [ ] See: "Fetching leaderboard data from: https://gdg-ajce.onrender.com/api/leaderboard"
- [ ] See: "Response status: 200"
- [ ] See: "Received data (first item):" with full object

#### 4. Test Top Performers
- [ ] Shows 3 performers
- [ ] In podium order (2nd, 1st, 3rd)
- [ ] Displays names and points
- [ ] Shows institution/track

#### 5. Test Statistics Cards
- [ ] Participants count is correct
- [ ] Total Points is sum of all points
- [ ] Avg. Modules is reasonable number

#### 6. Test Search
- [ ] Type in search box
- [ ] Feels instant (no lag)
- [ ] Results filter correctly
- [ ] Works with partial names

#### 7. Test Profile Icons
- [ ] Icons are clickable
- [ ] Opens Google Cloud Skills Boost profile
- [ ] Opens in new tab
- [ ] Correct URL

#### 8. Test Sorting
- [ ] Click column headers
- [ ] Table re-sorts
- [ ] Works for all sortable columns

#### 9. Test Mobile View
- [ ] Resize browser or use mobile device
- [ ] Cards display correctly
- [ ] All data is visible
- [ ] Touch interactions work

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

#### "BUILD FAILURE" when building
```powershell
# Check Java version
java -version
# Should be Java 17 or higher

# Try cleaning Maven cache
./mvnw clean

# Try with verbose output
./mvnw clean package -X
```

#### Render Deploy Fails
1. Check Render logs for error messages
2. Verify environment variables are set (Google API credentials)
3. Check if service is set to auto-deploy
4. Try manual deploy from Render dashboard

#### API Returns 404
1. Check if service is running in Render
2. Verify the URL is correct
3. Check application.properties for correct configuration
4. Look at Render logs for startup errors

#### CORS Errors Persist
1. Verify CorsConfig.java is in the correct package
2. Check if @Configuration annotation is present
3. Ensure Spring Boot scans the config package
4. Restart the Render service

### Frontend Issues

#### Build Fails
```powershell
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install

# Try building again
npm run build
```

#### Netlify Build Fails
1. Check Netlify build logs
2. Verify build command: `npm run build`
3. Verify publish directory: `dist`
4. Check if package.json has all dependencies

#### Names Still Not Showing
1. Open browser console
2. Check "Received data (first item):"
3. Verify field names match (case-sensitive)
4. Check if backend is returning new format

#### Rankings Wrong
1. Check if data is sorted in console log
2. Verify Points field is present
3. Check sorting logic in code
4. Look for JavaScript errors

#### Search Still Laggy
1. Check if debounce is 150ms
2. Verify immediateSearch state is used
3. Check for console errors
4. Try clearing browser cache

## üìù Final Verification Script

Save this as `test-deployment.ps1` and run after deployment:

```powershell
# Test Backend
Write-Host "Testing Backend API..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://gdg-ajce.onrender.com/api/leaderboard"
$first = $response[0]

Write-Host "First user:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  Name: $($first.Name)"
Write-Host "  Points: $($first.Points)"
Write-Host "  Verified: $($first.Verified)"
Write-Host "  Total Users: $($response.Count)"

# Calculate total points
$totalPoints = ($response | Measure-Object -Property Points -Sum).Sum
Write-Host "  Total Points: $totalPoints" -ForegroundColor Yellow

Write-Host "`n‚úÖ Backend is working!" -ForegroundColor Green

# Test Frontend
Write-Host "`nTesting Frontend..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Please manually verify:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "1. Visit your Netlify URL"
Write-Host "2. Check leaderboard displays"
Write-Host "3. Check console for errors"
Write-Host "4. Test search functionality"
