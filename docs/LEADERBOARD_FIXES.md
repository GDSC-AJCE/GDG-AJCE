# Leaderboard Fixes - Names Display & Search Performance

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Names Not Displaying
**Problem:** The API returns field names with different casing than expected
- API uses: `"Name"` (capital N)
- Frontend was looking for: `"name"` or `"username"`

**Solution:** Updated data mapping in `Leaderboard.jsx`:
```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
name: row.username || row.name || ''

// After (correct):
name: row.Name || row.name || ''
```

**Complete field mapping:**
- `Name` ‚Üí `name`
- `Profile URL` ‚Üí `profileUrl` and `handle`
- `Skill Badges Completed` ‚Üí `skillBadges`
- `Arcade Games Completed` ‚Üí `arcadeGames`

### 2. üêå Search Feels Laggy
**Problem:** 300ms debounce delay made typing feel unresponsive

**Solutions Applied:**

#### A. Reduced Debounce Timing
- Changed from 300ms to 150ms
- Provides snappier response while still preventing excessive filtering

#### B. Immediate UI Feedback
- Added `immediateSearch` state in `useLeaderboard.js`
- Search input updates instantly in the UI
- Filtering happens after debounce
- User sees their typing immediately without lag

#### C. Optimized Filter Function
- Added null/empty checks before string operations
- Trim search term before filtering
- Early return for empty searches
- Prevents errors on missing name/handle fields

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/pages/Leaderboard.jsx`
- Fixed API field mapping to use correct capitalization
- Added console logging for debugging
- Maps `Name` ‚Üí `name`
- Maps `Profile URL` ‚Üí `profileUrl` and `handle`
- Maps `Skill Badges Completed` ‚Üí `skillBadges`
- Maps `Arcade Games Completed` ‚Üí `arcadeGames`

### 2. `src/hooks/useLeaderboard.js`
- Added `immediateSearch` state for instant UI updates
- Reduced debounce from 300ms to 150ms
- Returns immediate search value for display

### 3. `src/utils/helpers.js`
- Enhanced `filterMembers` function with null safety
- Added trim() to search terms
- Prevents crashes on empty name/handle fields
- Optimized search performance

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps:
1. Open the leaderboard page
2. Check browser console for data logs
3. Verify names are now visible in the table
4. Type in the search box - should feel responsive
5. Search results should appear within ~150ms

### Debug Script Created:
Run `test-api-mapping.js` in browser console to:
- View raw API data structure
- See mapped data
- Check for empty names
- View field population statistics

### To run the test:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Copy contents of `test-api-mapping.js`
3. Paste and run
4. View detailed analysis

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Names Display:
- All member names from API should now display
- Falls back gracefully if name is missing

### ‚úÖ Search Performance:
- Typing feels instant (no perceived lag)
- Results filter smoothly
- Debouncing prevents excessive computation
- Works correctly with partial names

### ‚úÖ Search Features:
- Searches both name and profile URL
- Case-insensitive matching
- Handles empty/null values safely
- Shows all results when search is cleared

## Performance Improvements

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Search debounce | 300ms | 150ms |
| UI update lag | 300ms | Instant |
| Filter safety | Could crash | Null-safe |
| Empty field handling | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

## API Response Format

The backend returns data in this format:
```json
{
  "Name": "John Doe",
  "Profile URL": "https://...",
  "Skill Badges Completed": 5,
  "Arcade Games Completed": 3
}
```

Frontend maps this to:
```javascript
{
  id: "https://...",
  name: "John Doe",
  handle: "https://...",
  profileUrl: "https://...",
  skillBadges: 5,
  arcadeGames: 3,
  rank: 1
}
```

## Next Steps

### If names still don't display:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for "Received data (first item):" log
3. Verify the exact field names from your API
4. Adjust mapping in Leaderboard.jsx if different

### If search still feels laggy:
1. Consider reducing debounce to 100ms
2. Check if there's a large dataset (1000+ items)
3. Consider implementing virtual scrolling for very large lists

### Future Enhancements:
- Add fuzzy search for typo tolerance
- Highlight matching text in results
- Add search result count display
- Implement search history

## Troubleshooting

### Console shows "Received data: undefined"
- Check CORS configuration on backend
- Verify API endpoint is accessible
- Check network tab for 404/500 errors

### Names still empty after fix:
- Run test-api-mapping.js to check actual field names
- API might use different field names
- Contact backend team to verify response format

### Search not filtering:
- Check console for JavaScript errors
- Verify filterMembers is being called
- Check that initialData is populated
