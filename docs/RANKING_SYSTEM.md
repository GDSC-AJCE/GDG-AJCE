# Ranking System Update - Skill Badges Priority

## Overview
Updated the leaderboard ranking system to prioritize **Skill Badges Completed** as the primary ranking criterion, with arcade and trivia games as tiebreakers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sorting Algorithm (`src/pages/Leaderboard.jsx`)

#### Previous System:
```javascript
// Sorted by Points
const sortedByPoints = [...boardJson].sort((a, b) => {
  const pointsA = a.Points || 0;
  const pointsB = b.Points || 0;
  return pointsB - pointsA;
});
```

#### New System:
```javascript
// Sorted by Skill Badges with tiebreakers
const sortedBySkillBadges = [...boardJson].sort((a, b) => {
  // Primary: Skill Badges Completed
  const skillBadgesB - skillBadgesA;
  
  // Tiebreaker 1: Arcade Games
  if (tied on badges) → sort by arcade games
  
  // Tiebreaker 2: Trivia Games
  if (still tied) → sort by trivia games
});
```

### 2. Ranking Priority

#### New Hierarchy:
1. **🏆 Skill Badges Completed** (Primary)
2. **🎮 Arcade Games Completed** (1st Tiebreaker)
3. **🎯 Trivia Games Completed** (2nd Tiebreaker)

### 3. Default Sort State (`src/hooks/useLeaderboard.js`)

```javascript
// Before
field: 'points'

// After
field: 'skillBadges'
```

### 4. Top Performers Display (`src/components/TopPerformers.jsx`)

#### Before:
```jsx
{member.track} • {formatNumber(member.points)} pts
```

#### After:
```jsx
{member.skillBadges || 0} Skill Badges
```

Now shows skill badge count instead of points for top performers.

## Ranking Logic Explained

### Example Scenario:

```
User A: 10 Skill Badges, 5 Arcade, 3 Trivia
User B: 10 Skill Badges, 5 Arcade, 2 Trivia
User C: 10 Skill Badges, 7 Arcade, 1 Trivia
User D: 12 Skill Badges, 0 Arcade, 0 Trivia
User E: 9 Skill Badges, 10 Arcade, 10 Trivia

Rankings:
1st: User D (12 badges)
2nd: User C (10 badges, 7 arcade)
3rd: User A (10 badges, 5 arcade, 3 trivia)
4th: User B (10 badges, 5 arcade, 2 trivia)
5th: User E (9 badges)
```

### Sorting Steps:

1. **Compare Skill Badges**
   - If different → higher wins
   - If same → go to step 2

2. **Compare Arcade Games** (Tiebreaker 1)
   - If different → higher wins
   - If same → go to step 3

3. **Compare Trivia Games** (Tiebreaker 2)
   - Higher wins
   - If still tied → maintain original order

## Visual Changes

### Leaderboard Table:
- Ranks now reflect skill badge count
- User with most skill badges = Rank #1
- Rankings update when skill badges change

### Top Performers Cards:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ 👑 1st Place        │
│ John Doe            │
│ 15 Skill Badges     │ ← Shows badge count
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Stats Cards:
- No changes to stats display
- Still shows total points, participants, etc.

## Why Skill Badges?

### Rationale:
1. **Higher Difficulty**: Skill badges require more effort than arcade/trivia
2. **Learning Focus**: Emphasizes actual skill development
3. **Fair Competition**: Rewards quality over quantity
4. **Program Goals**: Aligns with Study Jam objectives

### Points System Comparison:
```
Old Ranking (by Points):
- User with 5 badges + 20 arcade = 30 points (Rank 1)
- User with 10 badges + 0 arcade = 20 points (Rank 2)

New Ranking (by Skill Badges):
- User with 10 badges + 0 arcade = Rank 1 ✅
- User with 5 badges + 20 arcade = Rank 2
```

## User Sorting Flexibility

### Column Sorting Still Available:
Users can still click column headers to sort by:
- ✅ Skill Badges (default)
- ✅ Arcade Games
- ✅ Points
- ✅ Streak
- ✅ Any other column

### Default View:
- Opens sorted by Skill Badges
- Shows true competitive standings
- Reflects Study Jam priorities

## Impact on Features

### ✅ Affected Features:

1. **Leaderboard Rankings**
   - Rank numbers based on skill badges
   - Sequential: 1, 2, 3...
   - **Ranks stay consistent regardless of table sorting** ✨

2. **Top 3 Performers**
   - Shows users with most skill badges
   - Displays badge count instead of points

3. **Default Sort**
   - Table opens sorted by skill badges
   - Arrow indicator on Skill Badges column

4. **User Table Sorting** 🆕
   - Users can sort by any column (name, streak, arcade games, etc.)
   - **Rank column always shows skill badge rank, even when table is sorted differently**
   - Example: Sort by "Arcade Games" → ranks still show skill badge position

### ❌ Unchanged Features:

1. **Stats Cards**
   - Still shows total points
   - Still shows total participants
   - No changes to calculations

2. **Weekly Chart**
   - Still shows point progression
   - Historical data unchanged

3. **User Sorting**
   - Can still sort by any column
   - All sorting options available

## Testing Checklist

### Verify Rankings:
- [ ] User with most skill badges is Rank #1
- [ ] Rankings are sequential (1, 2, 3...)
- [ ] Tiebreakers work correctly
- [ ] No duplicate ranks
- [ ] **Ranks remain consistent when sorting by other columns** ✨

### Verify Top Performers:
- [ ] Shows top 3 by skill badges
- [ ] Displays badge count
- [ ] Podium order correct (2nd, 1st, 3rd on desktop)

### Verify Sorting:
- [ ] Default sort is skill badges
- [ ] Can click to sort by other columns
- [ ] Arrow indicator shows on correct column
- [ ] Sorting is stable (no jumping)

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Users with 0 badges appear at bottom

- [ ] All ties resolved consistently

## Console Logs

### Check Browser Console:
```javascript
console.log('Received data (first item):', boardJson[0]);
// Shows: Skill Badges Completed, Arcade Games, etc.

// Top 3 should have highest skill badge counts
```

## Migration Notes

### No Data Migration Needed:
- Backend API unchanged
- Frontend recalculates rankings on load
- Historical data preserved

### User Impact:
- Rankings may change (expected)
- Some users move up, some down
- Based on skill badges now

## Documentation Updates

### Updated Files:
- ✅ `src/pages/Leaderboard.jsx` - Sorting logic
- ✅ `src/hooks/useLeaderboard.js` - Default sort
- ✅ `src/components/TopPerformers.jsx` - Display

### Documentation:
- ✅ Created `RANKING_SYSTEM.md`
- ✅ Updated code comments
- ✅ Clear sorting logic
- ✅ Fixed `assignRanks()` to maintain consistent ranks

### Technical Implementation:

#### `assignRanks()` Function (`src/utils/helpers.js`):
```javascript
// Before: Ranks changed based on current sort
return members.map((member, index) => ({
  ...member,
  rank: index + 1  // ❌ Wrong - changes with sort
}));

// After: Ranks always based on skill badges
const sortedBySkillBadges = [...members].sort(/* skill badge sort */);
const rankMap = new Map();
sortedBySkillBadges.forEach((member, index) => {
  rankMap.set(member.id, index + 1);  // ✅ True rank
});
return members.map(member => ({
  ...member,
  rank: rankMap.get(member.id)  // ✅ Consistent rank
}));
```

#### How It Works:
1. **Calculate True Ranks**: Sort a copy by skill badges → assign ranks 1, 2, 3...
2. **Create Rank Map**: Store each member's true rank in a Map (by ID)
3. **Apply to Display**: Apply true ranks to members regardless of display sort order
4. **Result**: Rank column shows skill badge position even when sorting by other columns

## Summary

### Before Update:
- 🎯 Ranked by total points
- Points = (Badges × 2) + Arcade + Trivia
- Quantity over quality
- ❌ Ranks changed when sorting table by different columns

### After Update:
- 🏆 Ranked by Skill Badges Completed
- Tiebreakers: Arcade → Trivia
- Quality over quantity
- Better alignment with program goals
- ✅ **Ranks stay consistent regardless of table sort order**

### Example: Consistent Ranking

```
Alice: Rank #1 (15 skill badges, 3 arcade, 100 streak)
Bob:   Rank #2 (12 skill badges, 8 arcade, 50 streak)
Carol: Rank #3 (10 skill badges, 12 arcade, 150 streak)
```

#### Table Sorted by Skill Badges (Default):
```
